Auto web authenticated wireless network login
=================================================

This piece of software allows users to automatically connect to a web authenticated wireless network. 
The project was launched due to a request by my myself to automatically login to my school network.

## Motivation
 - Send the necessary HTTP request, the browser would send if the user was logged in through the login page.
 - Automate the login process so the user has to login only once.

## Core concepts and ideas
 - Inversion of control driven application design
 - Model-View-Presenter approach, Views are in a passive state
 - Business logic encapsulated in services

## Used technologies and technical ideas
 - Client-only application architecture
 - JSR 299 for java-se (JBoss Weld)
 - JPA 2.0
 - H2 embedded database
 - Java FX 2+
 - JDK 1.7 (maybe 1.8 in a upcoming version?)
 - Apache Maven
 - Java Native Interface (get notifications about network activities of underlining os)
 
## Diagrams in lovely UML
UML diagrams are modeled in astah community version.  
Some others are made with MS Visio.

### Basic usecases

#### Further explanations
A supersudent acts as an administrator. He defines registrations for his school. A registration consists of the same necessary information, the login page would send, if the student was logged in through this page.

    <FORM method="post" ACTION="/login.html">  
    	<INPUT type="TEXT" name="username" SIZE="25" MAXLENGTH="80" VALUE="">  
    	<INPUT type="TEXT" name="password" SIZE="25" MAXLENGTH="80" VALUE="">  
    </FORM>

Based on these registrations, students are now able to create profiles for their accounts.  
After the profile is setup, the *automated web authenticated wireless network login* mechanism is able to login the user automatically. This mechanism is controlled by the Start - and Stop connection tracking usecases.

### Component diagram
This picuture is showing the basic components of the application. Keep in mind the application is in a client-only application architecture. Everything is basically the java-fx client.
